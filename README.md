## Some Context
Hello, my name is Chae, I am an engineering people and process manager. Software craftsmanship and architecture
will never cease to be interesting and fun for me, but with respect to my role and focus these days,
my priorities are more service oriented to others, so to speak.

I found a few hours to code over holiday break in 2018, and decided to do *something*.

As of Jan 2019, I'm approaching my third trimester of pregnancy. Moving forward, I will be
spending my spare time practicing hypnosis for another amazing medication-free water birth.
